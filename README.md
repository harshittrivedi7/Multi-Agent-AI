‚ú® Features
Multi-Agent Architecture: Implements two specialized agents:

Text Agent: Handles general knowledge questions, conversation, and text generation.

Image Agent: Analyzes uploaded images to answer specific questions about their content.

Dynamic UI: The user interface, built with Streamlit, dynamically changes based on the selected interaction mode.

Central Orchestrator: Simple yet effective logic routes the user's prompt to the appropriate agent.

Image Q&A: Users can upload images (jpg, png, webp) and ask questions directly about them.

Conversation History: The session state is used to maintain a running history of the conversation for context.

Secure API Key Handling: Uses a .env file to securely manage the Google API key, with a fallback to manual input.
